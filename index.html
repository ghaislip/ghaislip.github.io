        I created this website to share my professional experience and education with others. I will expand this site (and probably update the look and implement a blog too)
        throughout my career. I feel that this will be especially important as I start my journey into the working world.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Fast-learning and dedicated. Those are the two terms that I use to describe myself the best. After my first few years of studies, in which I wrote my first
        line of code on day one, I have came a long way. I've met new friends, worked with great people, and have gained lots of programming
        skills that I didn't know even existed a year ago. I had the time of my life and am looking forward to going back to class again in the fall.
        <br />
        <br />
        My career started as a software engineering CO-OP at ADTRAN's headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama. While there,
	I worked on two different agile teams. My teams treated me well and took the time to help me grow as an engineer to the point
	where I was doing real development work for fiber equipment as just an intern. The next summer I interned as SAIC.
	I began writing tests for a missle system, but later on I switched to implementing dev-ops technologies for it. I want to squeeze in
        one more internship in the summer of 2020. Hopefully, my experience throughout college will allow me to become an
	excellent software engineer and have some fun along the way.
