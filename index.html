        I created this website to share my professional experience and education with others. I will expand this site (and probably update the look and implement a blog too)
        throughout my career. I feel that this will be especially important as I start my journey into the working world.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Fast-learning and dedicated. Those are the two terms that I use to describe myself the best. After my first year of studies, in which I wrote my first
        line of code on day one, I have came a long way. I've met new friends, worked with great people, and have gained lots of programming
        skills that I didn't know even existed a year ago. I had the time of my life and am looking forward to going back to class again in the fall.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once January 2018 comes around, I will be starting my career as a software engineering CO-OP at ADTRAN's
        headquarters in Huntsville, Alabama. The CO-OP will last three semesters, alternating between work and school, and ending summer in 2019.
        Presumably, I will go through training (which I've been told is difficult) and will end up working on an agile development team.
        <a href="http://portal.adtran.com/web/page/portal/Adtran/wp_students">ADTRAN's student wepage</a>
        states that I will be doing all this alongside professionals to make important contributions to their company.
        The experience should be an excellent taste of what's to come for my career. I want to squeeze in
        internships in the two free summers I have left as well. Hopefully, my experience throughout college will allow me to become an excellent
        software engineer and have some fun along the way.
